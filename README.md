# Python 🐍

```
I started getting involved with Python through my work as a researcher and developing and training generative
artificial intelligences and large language models to produce high quality code based on various
user requests. Currently, I am keep learning to create different machine learning and
artificial intelligence programs using PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, among others libraries.
I will be uploading those codes very soon.
