# Python 🐍

```
I started getting involved with Python through my work developing and training generative
artificial intelligences and large language models to produce high quality code based on various user requests.
Currently, I am learning to create different machine learning and artificial intelligence programs
using PyTorch and TensorFlow. I will be uploading those codes very soon.
