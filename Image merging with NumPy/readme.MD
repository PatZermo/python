# Image Merging with NumPy üêç
## A cool image merger

Did you know that images can be represented as matrices and tensors? In this case, two grayscale images are used. The idea in this code is to merge both images into one using NumPy.

Matrices are used instead of tensors since both images are two-dimensional, with rows and columns of the matrix representing their pixels in a single channel. If we were working with color images, we would need to use tensors to represent the RGB channels in the third dimension.

So, let's merge these two images:
