## Celsius to Farenheit with and without machine learning

```
The idea of this repository is to compare how the same task is carried out with and without using machine learning.
```

Traditional programming uses functions predefined by the programmer to achieve a result. In this case, the programmer has specified the mathematical operation to convert the Celsius degrees entered by the user into Fahrenheit, and vice versa.

**Would it be possible for the machine to learn by itself how to arrive at that operation just by giving it the initial number and the result? Yes! For that, we will use Machine Learning.**

In the [first machine learning example](#Celsius-to-Farenheit-with-machine-learning-), using the NumPy libraries to create arrays and TensorFlow for neural networks (and some matplotlib to plot the training), a machine learning algorithm is created. As can be seen in the code, at no point are the mathematical operations for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit provided; instead, the algorithm automatically learns them from an array of Celsius degrees and their corresponding Fahrenheit results. At the end of the code, the user can input any temperature in Celsius, and the algorithm will convert it to Fahrenheit.

In the [second traditional programming example](#Celsius-to-Farenheit-without-machine-learning-), the programmer has already preloaded the necessary mathematical operations to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The user can input temperatures, and they will be converted using the preloaded functions.
